## CreditCardField

This is the standard credit card field. It has individual fields and not based on Stripe. Newer case studies suggest individual fields can give a better return. More studies show that only showing the fields that are relevant to no overwhelm the user and clutter the UI before the user as comitted will improve results. This field attempts to build on those principles.

## InlineCreditCardField

This field mimics Stripe's elements UI. It works well unless the space is too narrow and the fields start to overlap.
